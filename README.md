# crudWithServlet

This project is the same as the other crud project of mine but im not doing all my java in jsp. I seperated jsps and java. I have used servlet for my java code. And another difference to it is that you dont have the another edit page, you edit and display in the same page. I used spring framewrok at my table to edit my table. After ediiting the table u just click update button for it to be registered to the database. Another difference is that you have a login page and a logout button. These are the main differences of my crud project and crudwithServlet project.
